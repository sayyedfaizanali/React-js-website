                       <span>People expect web app pages to load fast. On the server, React lets you start streaming HTML while you’re still fetching data, progressively filling in the remaining content before any JavaScript code loads. On the client, React can use standard web APIs to keep your UI responsive even in the middle of rendering.</span>

They look and feel native because their UIs are truly native. It’s not a web view—your React components render real Android and iOS views provided by the platform.</span>
